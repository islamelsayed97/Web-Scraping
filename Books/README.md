# books scraping
in this project I scraped the books details from this site "http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books_1/index.html"
this site contain on about 50 pages each one have 20 books. I get all the details of these books like title, price, rating, category 
and description and store them in CSV file. also I scraped all books posters and store them in a folder.
